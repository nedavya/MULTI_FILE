4 Stages of Poker:
1. Pre-flop
There is a round of betting once all players have received their 2 hole cards. This round of betting is initiated by 2 mandatory bets called blinds put into the pot by the 2 players to the left of the dealer. There's no need to confuse yourself here, they're mandatory so there is an incentive (a pot to win) for people to play.
2. Flop
3 cards are then dealt face up. This is called the flop. Another round of betting proceeds, starting with the player on the left of the dealer. (The dealer is just a position)
3. Turn
1 more card is then dealt face up. This is called the turn. Again, there is another round of betting, starting with the player on the left of the dealer.
4. River
The 5th and last card is then dealt face up. This is called the river. There is one final round of betting before all cards are turned face up â€“ the showdown.
-> Results: Winning the pot
